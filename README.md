# Apollodon

**Apollodon** is the thesis project of a team of researchers, designed to integrate the Water Quality Index (WQI) with predictive models. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for water monitoring systems by making datasets accessible not only to researchers but also to decision-makers and the general public through a user-friendly interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Integration of WQI and predictive models for comprehensive water quality monitoring.
- Accessible data visualization for researchers, policymakers, and the public.
- Modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- Built with the latest web technologies.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (Basic project structure)
- **React 19**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components

> **Note:** When installing components from `shadcn/ui`, use the `--force` flag to ensure compatibility:
> 
> ```bash
> npx shadcn add <component> --force
> ```
